I'm an immunologist and software engineer. I work at 
[Open Athena](https://www.openathena.ai/), a non-profit that helps researchers develop large
machine learning models. I also occasionally work with biotechs as an [independent consultant](https://inferenceprojects.com). 

Prior to this, I spent a year at a [focused research organization](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros) called [Imprint](https://www.imprint.org/)
that is trying to decode disease information hidden in immune receptor repertoires.

From 2020-2022, I was a senior scientist at the [Tisch Cancer Institute](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/tisch) at
the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I worked on
therapeutic cancer vaccines with [Nina Bhardwaj's group](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/nina-bhardwaj) 
with the goal of getting these therapies to benefit more patients
through better antigen selection. We ultimately launched [four](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02721043) [Phase](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03223103) [I](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03359239) [clinical](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05010200)
trials at Mount Sinai to evaluate our platform for a fully personalized peptide
vaccine targeting tumor neoantigens.

From 2017-2020, I was a PhD student advised by [Uri Laserson](https://twitter.com/laserson?lang=en). My [dissertation](/pdfs/TimODonnell-dissertation.pdf) introduced
new methods for T cell epitope prediction, which are implemented in the
[MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry) package. I also did some work
on antibody responses using phage immunoprecipitation
sequencing ([PhIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhIP-Seq)).

In 2018, I helped launch the 
[OpenVax](https://github.com/openvax) project to develop open source tools
for designing cancer vaccines. This grew out of work with
[Jeff Hammerbacher](https://www.hammerlab.org/) (2014-2017). The OpenVax tools
continue to be developed and have seen wide adoption by research groups and companies worldwide.

Prior to Mount Sinai, I worked at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)
(2009-2014) on analysis software for molecular dynamics simulations.
Before that, I helped build engineering teams
for several internet startups, and spent a summer interning at Google. I hold a
B.S. in Math & Computer Science from [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu) and
a PhD in Immunology from the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/).
