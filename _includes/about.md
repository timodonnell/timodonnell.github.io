I am a bioinformatician at the [Tisch Cancer Institute](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/tisch) at
the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I work on
therapeutic cancer vaccines with [Nina Bhardwaj's group](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/nina-bhardwaj),
and my goal is to help these emerging therapies benefit more
patients through smarter antigen selection. This often involves development of
bioinformatic tools, which we release through the [OpenVax](https://github.com/openvax) project.

From 2017-2020, I was a PhD student advised by [Uri Laserson](https://twitter.com/laserson?lang=en)
at Mount Sinai. My [dissertation](/pdfs/TimODonnell-dissertation.pdf) introduced
new methods for T cell epitope prediction, which are implemented in the
[MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry) package. I also did some work
on antibody responses using phage immunoprecipitation
sequencing ([PhIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhIP-Seq)).

In 2018, [Alex Rubinsteyn](https://twitter.com/iskander),
[Julia Kodysh](https://twitter.com/JuliaKodysh),
[Tavi Nathanson](https://twitter.com/tavinathanson) and I along with
[Nina Bhardwaj](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/nina-bhardwaj) and the [Icahn
Institute](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/genomics) launched the 
OpenVax project at Mount Sinai to develop open source [tools](https://github.com/openvax)
for selecting cancer vaccines. This grew out of work with
[Jeff Hammerbacher](https://www.hammerlab.org/) from 2014-2017. Our software
is used in four Phase I clinical trials at Mount Sinai.

Prior to Mount Sinai, I was at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)
(2009-2014) developing analysis software for molecular dynamics simulations. In earlier days, I worked as a
software engineer, helped put together engineering teams
for several internet startups, and spent a summer interning at Google. I hold a
B.S. in Math & Computer Science from [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu) and
a PhD in Immunology from the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/).
