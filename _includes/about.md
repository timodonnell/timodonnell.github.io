I am a computational biologist at the [Tisch Cancer Institute](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/tisch) at
the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/). I work on
therapeutic cancer vaccines with [Nina Bhardwaj](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/nina-bhardwaj),
and my research aims to improve vaccine efficacy through better antigen
selection. This often involves development of bioinformatics tools, which we
release through the [OpenVax](https://github.com/openvax) project. 

From 2017-2020, I did a PhD advised by [Uri Laserson](https://twitter.com/laserson?lang=en)
at Mount Sinai. My dissertation focused on T cell epitope prediction. I 
also did some work on antibody responses using phage immunoprecipitation
sequencing ([PhIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhIP-Seq)), a technology Uri
helped develop.

From 2014-2017, I worked with [Jeff Hammerbacher](https://www.hammerlab.org/) on
distributed computing approaches for analyzing cancer sequencing datasets. Prior to this,
I worked at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)
(2009-2014) on analysis software for long timescale molecular dynamics simulations.

In earlier days, I worked as a software engineer. I helped build teams
for several web startups and spent a summer interning at Google.
