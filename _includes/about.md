I'm an immunologist and software engineer. I currently work at 
[Open Athena](https://www.openathena.ai/), a non-profit that helps academic groups develop large
machine learning models. I also occasionally work with biotechs as a [technical consultant](https://inferenceprojects.com).

Prior to joining Open Athena, I spent a year at [Imprint](https://www.imprint.org/), a [focused research organization](https://www.convergentresearch.org/about-fros) that is working to decode disease information from immune receptor repertoires.

From 2014-2022, I worked at [Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/) in a few capacities:
* I was most recently a senior scientist at the [Tisch Cancer Institute](https://icahn.mssm.edu/research/tisch), where I worked with [Nina Bhardwaj's group](https://icahn.mssm.edu/profiles/nina-bhardwaj) on personalized cancer vaccines. We ultimately launched [four](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT02721043) [Phase](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03223103) [I](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT03359239) [clinical](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05010200)
trials to evaluate our platform.
* From 2017-2020, I did PhD with Uri Laserson in immunology. My [dissertation](/pdfs/TimODonnell-dissertation.pdf) introduced
new methods for T cell epitope prediction, which are implemented in the
[MHCflurry](https://github.com/openvax/mhcflurry) package. I also did some work
on antibody responses using phage immunoprecipitation
sequencing ([PhIP-seq](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PhIP-Seq)).
* I helped launch the [OpenVax](https://github.com/openvax) project
to develop open source tools for designing cancer vaccines. The OpenVax tools
have seen wide adoption by research groups and companies worldwide.
* OpenVax grew out of earlier work with [Jeff Hammerbacher](https://www.hammerlab.org/) at Mount Sinai (2014-2017).

Prior to Mount Sinai, I worked at [D.E. Shaw Research](https://www.deshawresearch.com/)
(2009-2014) on analysis software for molecular dynamics simulations.
Before that, I worked as a software engineer, helped put together engineering teams for two startups, and spent a summer interning at Google.

I hold a B.S. in Math & Computer Science from [Brown University](https://cs.brown.edu) and
a PhD in Immunology from the [Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai](https://icahn.mssm.edu/).
