title: Consulting
---

I find it very satisfying to work closely with clients to develop new
therapies and technologies. I approach consulting as a scientific collaboration,
and I put a lot of energy into fully understanding the scientific and
business context for each problem I take on.

I focus on two problem domains:
* **Tumor immunity and immuno-informatics**<br />
Cancer antigen discovery and T cell epitope prediction, bioinformatic workflows for 
clinical application of cancer vaccines, design and analysis of sequencing,
immunopeptidomics or immunoprofiling experiments

* **Protein design for vaccines and biologics**<br />
Engineered immunogens, computationally-informed library design, de-immunization
of biologics

The deliverables for my projects are typically candidate
sequences/compounds, predictive models, or software. I also advise on
technical strategy, hiring, experimental design, bioinformatic approaches, and software
engineering practice.

I give preference to projects that have the potential to address a major
unmet medical need. I have worked with multinational corporations, preclinical and clinical-stage biotech
companies, and academic medical institutions.
