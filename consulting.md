title: Consulting
---

I approach consulting as a scientific collaboration. I find it extremely
satisfying to work closely with clients to address their
needs with attention to the larger scientific and business context. 

My deliverables are usually computationally-generated lead sequences/compounds,
predictive models, or bioinformatic workflows. I can also advise on
technical strategy, experimental design, and software engineering practice.

My work focuses on two areas:
* *Tumor immunity and immuno-informatics*: Cancer
antigen discovery and T cell epitope prediction, bioinformatic workflows for 
clinical application of cancer vaccines, design and analysis of sequencing,
immunopeptidomics or immunoprofiling experiments
* *Computational structural biology for vaccines and biologics*: Immunogen design for a desired antibody
response, optimization of biologics (e.g. de-immunization, stability enhancements)

I give preference to projects that have the potential to address a major
unmet medical need and/or release some part of any developed software as open source. 
I have worked with multinational corporations, preclinical and clinical-stage biotech
companies, and academic medical institutions.
