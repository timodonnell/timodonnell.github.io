title: Consulting

I find it extremely satisfying to work closely with clients to develop new
therapies and technologies. I approach consulting as a scientific collaboration,
and I put a lot of energy into fully understanding the scientific and
business context for each problem I take on.

My deliverables are usually computationally-generated lead sequences/compounds,
predictive models, or software. I also advise on
technical strategy, experimental design, bioinformatic approaches, and software
engineering practice.

I focus on two problem domains:
* **Tumor immunity and immuno-informatics**<br />Cancer
antigen discovery and T cell epitope prediction, bioinformatic workflows for 
clinical application of cancer vaccines, design and analysis of sequencing,
immunopeptidomics or immunoprofiling experiments

* **Computational structural biology for vaccines and biologics**<br /> Immunogen 
design for a desired antibody response, smart library design, de-immunization and
other optimization of biologics

I give preference to projects that have the potential to address a major
unmet medical need. I have worked with multinational corporations, preclinical and clinical-stage biotech
companies, and academic medical institutions.
