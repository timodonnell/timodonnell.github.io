title: Consulting
---

I find it extremely satisfying to help ambitious clients develop new therapies
and technologies. I approach consulting as a scientific collaboration, and I
put a lot of energy into understanding the larger scientific and business context
for each problem I take on.

My deliverables are usually computationally-generated lead sequences/compounds,
predictive models, or software. I can also advise on
technical strategy, experimental design, bioinformatic approaches, and software
engineering practice.

I focus on two areas:
* **Tumor immunity and immuno-informatics**<br />Cancer
antigen discovery and T cell epitope prediction, bioinformatic workflows for 
clinical application of cancer vaccines, design and analysis of sequencing,
immunopeptidomics or immunoprofiling experiments

* **Computational structural biology for vaccines and biologics**<br /> Immunogen 
design for a desired antibody response, smart library design, de-immunization or
other optimization of biologics

I give preference to projects that have the potential to address a major
unmet medical need and/or release some part of any developed software as open source. 
I have worked with multinational corporations, preclinical and clinical-stage biotech
companies, and academic medical institutions.
