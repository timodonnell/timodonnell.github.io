The MHCflurry 2.0 paper is out now in *Cell Systems*. The most interesting thing
here is our experimental antigen processing predictor, which
is trained to identify MHC allele-independent features that affect how likely
a peptide is to be presented on MHC. <br />See also: the MHCflurry 1.0 [paper](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cels.2018.05.014)
and a short book [chapter](https://link.springer.com/protocol/10.1007%2F978-1-0716-0327-7_8)
on using MHCflurry 1.0.
