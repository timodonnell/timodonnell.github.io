We developed improved models for predicting the antigens available for
recognition by cytotoxic T cells. Separate predictors of MHC class I binding and
antigen processing were trained using published datasets of peptides naturally
presented on MHC. The software is open source and readily incorporated into
workflows for neoantigen discovery and vaccine design.
