Tumors that have high levels of mutations
within microsatellites (MSI-H)
demonstrate specific frameshifts that are
then expressed at the RNA and protein
levels across endometrial, colorectal, and
stomach cancers. Epitopes from these
frameshifts yield neoantigens that are
distinct from self and viral antigens and
elicit T cell responses.
