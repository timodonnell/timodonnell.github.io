Early in the pandemic, we designed a SARS-CoV-2 peptide vaccine containing
epitope regions optimized for concurrent B cell, CD4+ T cell, and CD8+ T cell
stimulation. Strong T cell responses were observed in 7/10 T cell epitope
optimized peptides following vaccination. Humoral responses were deficient,
likely due to the unrestricted conformational space inhabited by linear vaccine peptides.
