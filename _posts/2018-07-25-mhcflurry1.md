Accurate prediction servers for MHC I
ligands have been in wide use for some
time, but these tools are typically closed
source, may be trained only by their
developers, and can be challenging to
integrate into high-throughput workflows
required for tumor neoantigen discovery.
We introduce a prediction package that
exposes a programmatic interface, may
be modified and re-retrained, and is much
faster than existing tools.
