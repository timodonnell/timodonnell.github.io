We show by analysis of structures, binding kinetics and long time-scale molecular
dynamics simulations that antibody evolution in a broadly neutralizing influenza
antibody lineage has rigidified the initially flexible heavy-chain complementarity
determining region by two nearly independent pathways and that this preconfiguration accounts for most of the affinity gain.
