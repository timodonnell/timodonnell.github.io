[Nicolas Vabret](http://twitter.com/neoviral) and I wrote a highlight in NRI
about an interesting [preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.09.10.457789v1)
from Sebastian Amigorena's group at the Institut Curie. They show that TLR4 stimulation
triggers expression of endogenous retroelements, which in turn further amplify the
IFN I response. This was organized through Nicolas's immunology [Preprint Club](https://www.preprintclub.com/), which is
worth checking out.
